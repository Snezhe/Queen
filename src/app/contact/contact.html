        <p style="width: 59%; text-align: center; float: left;">Queen released their self-titled debut album in 1973. Despite not being an immediate success, Queen gained popularity in Britain with their second album Queen II in 1974. Their 1975 song, "Bohemian Rhapsody", was number 1 for nine weeks (and a further five weeks in 1991) and is the third biggest selling single of all time in the UK. In the U.S., Bohemian Rhapsody hit the Billboard Top 40 charts in three different decades, reaching number 9 in its original 1975 release, number 2 in 1992 after being featured in the film Wayne's World, and hitting the Top 40 once more in 2018 upon the release of the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody. The band's 1981 Greatest Hits album is the biggest selling album in UK history with 6.0 million copies sold by 2014. The band's 1991 compilation Greatest Hits II is also one of the UK's top ten biggest sellers of all time, with 3.8 million copies sold by 2012.</p>

        <p style="width: 59%; text-align: center; float: right;">In 1991, Queen's entire catalogue was remastered and released by Hollywood on CD in the United States, and thirteen albums were remastered at Abbey Road Studios and released on CD and cassette in the United Kingdom between July 1993 and March 1994. Queen's entire album back catalogue was remastered and re-released in the UK and rest of the world through 2011 to commemorate their 40th anniversary. The 2011 remasters were released by Universal's Island Records label, as the band's contract with EMI Records ended in 2010. The 2011 remasters were released on SACD by Universal Music Japan, between November 2011 and April 2012. In an interview with BBC Wales, Brian May announced a new compilation album titled Queen Forever, which was later released by Hollywood in November 2014. </p>
